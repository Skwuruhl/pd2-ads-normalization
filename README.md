# pd2-ads-normalization

By default Payday 2 uses 75% screen distance normalization and if that's what you want then you don't need this.

This mod makes zoom sensitivity scale by focal length or the zoom ratio.

To install put the \Aim Sensitivity Fix\ folder into the \mods\ folder

Ensure you have ADS FOV scaling enabled in options and that all sensitivity values are set to be exactly the same.
