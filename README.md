# pd2-ads-normalization

By default Payday 2 uses 75% screen distance normalization and if that's what you want then you don't need this.

This mod by default will be 0%

If you want a different % then replace \Aim Sensitivity Fix\lib\Lua\NormalizedSens.lua with the filed located in \Alternate Match\. Then edit the file and set matchDistance to what you want, by default it's at 50%.

To install put the \Aim Sensitivity Fix\ folder into the \mods\ folder

Ensure you have ADS FOV scaling enabled in options and that all sensitivity values are set to be exactly the same.
